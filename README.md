# NextChest

My repository for Riot Games API Challenge 2016

Title: NextChest
Created by: Kiritoc

Working App: <http://nextchest-kirdox.rhcloud.com/>

> NextChest is a website designed by a summoner for summoners.<br>
> This app was created in order to help chest hunters meanwhile training my development skills.<br>
> The app is using a cache (Redis) in order to decrease response times as well as the total number of requests made.
Furthermore a queuing system was implemented to be sure to not exceed the rate limit of the Riot API.
